# Coloured-Matrix

In this project, we are requested to create a function that will take as input an image that represents 
every time a coloured matrix in different projections and orientations. More precisely, each time the 
images contain a matrix that is consisted of 16 squares where each square is randomly coloured with 
one individual colour. The function then will have to correctly identify the colour of each square and 
display its output in a 4x4 matrix that is reflecting the given image. The colours that are used in the
images are white, blue, green, red, and yellow: and for better understanding, the output matrix is 
displaying the identified colour with its first letter. The set of images that the code has been written 
for is the ‘images2’ set, which as I mentioned above it contains images in various orientation and 
projections and images with noise.
